    🔎 What is this app?
    This app allows you to train, evaluate and optimize a Machine Learning model for **User Throughput Downlink Prediction** in just a few clicks. All you have to do is to upload a 4G LTE network  dataset from the **G-Net Track Application** or just choose the existing dataset in this app, and follow the guidelines in the sidebar to:
     🧪  Prepare data : Filter, aggregate, preprocess, and/or clean your dataset step by step.
     🛠️  Choose model parameters : Default parameters are available but you can tune them. Look at the tooltips to understand how each parameter is impacting forecasts.
     📝  Select evaluation method : Gain the metrics evaluation score and Define the evaluation process to assess your model performance.
     🔮  Generate forecast : Make a forecast on future throughput value with the model previously trained. <br>
